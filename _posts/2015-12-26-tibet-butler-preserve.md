Over this past weekend I went to the Tibet-Butler Nature Perserve in Orlando, Florida. The Tibet-Butler Preserve offers a spot of wilderness in the dense urban mass of downtown Disney to the west of Orlando. The trial system loops through many of the major habitats found in this region, including longleaf pine forest and scrub, Bayhead swamp, and cypress-lined lakeshore. Unfortunately when I went, two of the trails---which included the largest trail---were closed do to flooding. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f9f402ff-be83-43da-999d-bef6b0054770.jpg)

When you arrive and go to start the trail if you go to left you'll be taken to Pinewood Circle where you'll see all sorts of longlead pines. Even with the trials close I was still able to walk ~2 miles of trials and saw many types of plants with no big wildlife. There was plenty of small wildlife like bugs, butterflies, and lizards.

If you go out to Taraflower Loop you'll see endangered lichen. 

Follow the loop around and take a left to go out to Osprey Overlook. You'll be looking out over the Tibet Bulter Lake.

Also, if you time it right you might even get to see their turtle, Darwin. They might let you touch him.. 

All of these images were taken on a Sony NEX 5 with a Samyang SY14M-C lens. Follow me on [500px][0] or [Instagram][1] for more!
